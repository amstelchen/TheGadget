#### SQLite table layout

To design an SQLite table layout for a strategy game incorporating the places, people, technology, and dates related to the Manhattan Project, you can create separate tables for each entity and establish relationships between them using primary and foreign keys. Here's a suggested table layout:

    Table: Places
        Columns: place_id (Primary Key), name, latitude, longitude

    Table: People
        Columns: person_id (Primary Key), name, birth_date, birth_place_id (Foreign Key referencing Places.place_id)

    Table: Technology
        Columns: tech_id (Primary Key), name, description

    Table: Dates
        Columns: date_id (Primary Key), event_date, description

    Table: Projects
        Columns: project_id (Primary Key), name, start_date_id (Foreign Key referencing Dates.date_id), end_date_id (Foreign Key referencing Dates.date_id)

    Table: Project_People
        Columns: project_id (Foreign Key referencing Projects.project_id), person_id (Foreign Key referencing People.person_id)

    Table: Project_Technology
        Columns: project_id (Foreign Key referencing Projects.project_id), tech_id (Foreign Key referencing Technology.tech_id)

    Table: Project_Places
        Columns: project_id (Foreign Key referencing Projects.project_id), place_id (Foreign Key referencing Places.place_id)

    Table: Buildings
        Columns: building_id (Primary Key), name, coords_polygon, place_id (Foreign Key referencing Places.place_id)

In this table layout, the "Places" table stores information about the different locations related to the Manhattan Project, including their latitude and longitude coordinates.

The "People" table contains details about the individuals involved, including their birth date and birth place, which is linked to the "Places" table through a foreign key relationship.

The "Technology" table holds information about the various technologies or scientific advancements relevant to the project. The "Dates" table stores significant dates and corresponding descriptions.

The "Projects" table represents individual projects within the Manhattan Project, with start and end dates linked to the "Dates" table. The "Project_People," "Project_Technology," and "Project_Places" tables establish many-to-many relationships between projects, people, technologies, and places.

The "Buildings" table stores information about the different buildings on each site related to the Manhattan Project, including their polygon coordinates for each building.

This table layout allows for the organization and retrieval of data related to the various entities and their relationships in the game, facilitating gameplay mechanics, historical accuracy, and data management.
